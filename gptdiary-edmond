## 3. **Interaction with ChatGPT**

### Questions/Requests to ChatGPT
Write down the questions or requests you made to ChatGPT. 
Also include what code from ChatGPT you are unsure of and craft a question that asks for further clarification. 
 For example:

- "How do I reverse a list in Python?"
- "Can you suggest a more efficient way to sort a list?"
- Why did ChatGPT opt for create element when my teacher suggested insertAdjacentHTML?

```text
# Example prompt to ChatGPT:
How can I optimize this sorting function for large datasets?
```
