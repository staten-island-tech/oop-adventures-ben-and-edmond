## 2. **Initial Approach/Code**

Describe the initial approach you took to solving the problem. If you started writing code, include it here.

```python
# Example: Initial sorting function
def sort_numbers(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)
```

- What was your plan for solving the problem?

## 3. **Interaction with ChatGPT**

### Questions/Requests to ChatGPT
Write down the questions or requests you made to ChatGPT. 
Also include what code from ChatGPT you are unsure of and craft a question that asks for further clarification. 
 For example:

- "How do I reverse a list in Python?"
- "Can you suggest a more efficient way to sort a list?"
- Why did ChatGPT opt for create element when my teacher suggested insertAdjacentHTML?

```text
# Example prompt to ChatGPT:
How can I optimize this sorting function for large datasets?
```

There were some problems that i didn't understand so i asked my brother to explain and help me, the major problem was running the map again after a game had been finished playing, this was sloved through seperating the map because the map file would run both the map and the game, it was seperated into main and map.
